# Message Web Service Application

## Objective

To develop a scalable HTTP API service for sending and receiving messages between accounts. 

The service will have the following features:

- Build APIs for getting all messages for an account, creating new messages, and searching messages based on various filters. Make sure to implement logging / error handling.
- Containerize the service using Docker with security best practices.
- Use Python/Go as the preferred language for development.
- Integrate MySQL/Postgres database for persistence.
- Deploy the webservice in Kubernetes.
- Implement zero downtime deployments, autoscaling, monitoring, and log aggregation on Kubernetes.
- Write Terraform scripts to provision a Kubernetes cluster on AWS.
- Setup firewall rules and networking.
- Build a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate deployments.
